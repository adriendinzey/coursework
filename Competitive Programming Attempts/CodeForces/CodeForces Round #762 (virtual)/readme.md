### Notes
Immediately after I finished this one I realized my issue was not trusting Python's integer division as I incorrectly read its description as rounding to the nearest integer. 
Making a small change from using int(num/10) to num//10 whenever I needed that division (looking back i should'nt have assumed int() uses the floor function) accepted that submission
At least now I know for sure Python's integer division is consistent with other languages!
