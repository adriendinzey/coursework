# so the only possible cases we have are when [x>c1 and y>c2], [x>c1 and y=c2], [x=c1,y>c2] and [x=c1 and y=c2]
#this means we need only to check for possible c1 values that are less than or equal to the given x and c2 values that are less than or equal to the given y
#in the case where there is a value for c2 that satisfies the given conditions and it is equal to y, then we know c1 will simply equal x/2-y/2
#in the case where there is a value for c1 that satisfies the given conditions and it is equal to x, then we know c2 will simply equal -x/2+y/2
#in the case we are given x=0,y=0 then c1=0,c2=0.
 
#since we only need to return one possible soultion
# When x>y I will give the case where c2=y and c1=x/2-y/2
# When y>x I will give the case where c1=x and c2=-x/2+y/2
 
# Then, there is one final condition that needs to be checked, when one number is odd and one number is even
# In this case it causes -x/2+y/2 or x/2-y/2 to be a decimal number instead of an integer. 
# then we must find a case where (x+y)/2=c1+c2, we know this is only possible when x>c1 and y>c2 so we must check all integers where this is possible.
